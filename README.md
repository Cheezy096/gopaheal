# gopaheal

A very simple rule34.paheal.net posts crawler in golang.

### Why?

It's not about the porn, it's about making a statement.

There was this python variant called [Rule34 Posts-Wrapper](https://github.com/nukdokplex/rule34-posts-wrapper/)
and I wanted the functionality of collecting all posts with a given tag but in golang for a project so that I
did not have to bother with dealing with python, pyinstaller and the slowness both python and pyinstaller brings.

This does not have all the same features or even string sanitization but it does what I want it to do and that is good
enough.
